Building blocks for your Compose Multiplatform Design System.

Primitive components and utilities for Mobile 📱, Tv 📺, Desktop 🖥️, and Web 🕸️.

All components are unstyled, accessible, and modular, designed for direct use or as foundations in
design systems.

## Motivation

This library was created to streamline component sharing for design systems on Android Tv and other
Compose target platforms. Most design systems use Material as their base, but that comes with its
own styling and a lot of additional components that are not always needed.

Wild breaks down essential parts into modular, lightweight components allowing teams to include only
what they need to build their own custom DS.

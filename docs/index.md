# Wild Primitives

Primitive components library for Android Tv to help kickstart your design system.

All components are unstyled, accessible & modular to be used directly or as building 
blocks for your design system.

## Why?

Most design systems are either built on top of Material, made completely from scratch or a mix of 
both. 

Wild takes some of the main aspects of Android Material Tv library and breaks it up into smaller
lighter weight modules so you only need to depend on what you need while also maintaining full 
support for accessibility and states like focus. Making it a lighter weight choice to build your 
design system from.

## Just Android Tv?

For now, yes.

Tv has less support in general for a lot of UI libraries and having built multiple design systems
on Tv I found myself solving the same Tv problems over and over again. 

However, I may decide to look at more platforms in time but lets see how useful this is...
